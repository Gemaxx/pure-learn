I'm learning UI/UX Course and now I'm on making wire frames
and I have exercise to make one for example in the coures for a restaurant, instead I wanna make it on my own graduation project, so 
before wire frames there is a phase

i show u the work flow that i follow 

UI/UX WORKFLOW
A Comprehensive Guide
1. DISCOVER & RESEARCH
‚Ä¢	Gather Requirements:
Collect information from clients or stakeholders about project goals, target audience, and key functionalities.
‚Ä¢	Market & Competitor Research:
Analyze market trends and competitors‚Äô products to understand what works and identify opportunities.
‚Ä¢	User Research & Personas:
Conduct user interviews, surveys, or usability tests to gather insights. Develop personas to represent your target users.
2. DEFINE & PLAN
‚Ä¢	Scope Definition:
Clearly outline the project‚Äôs scope, including key features and functionalities.
‚Ä¢	User Journey & Flowcharts:
Create user journey maps and flowcharts to visualize how users will interact with your product.
‚Ä¢	Information Architecture:
Plan the structure of your content, navigation, and page hierarchy.
3. WIREFRAMING
‚Ä¢	Sketch & Low-Fidelity Wireframes:
Start with simple sketches to outline the basic layout of your screens.
‚Ä¢	Digital Wireframes:
Use tools like Figma to create low-fidelity wireframes that focus on layout and structure rather than visual details.
‚Ä¢	Validation:
Share wireframes with your team or potential users for early feedback and adjustments.
4. VISUAL DESIGN
‚Ä¢	High-Fidelity Mockups:
Develop detailed mockups in Figma that include color, typography, and imagery.
‚Ä¢	Design Systems & Components:
Build or adopt a design system to ensure consistency across all screens. Utilize component-based design for reusable elements.
‚Ä¢	Responsive Design:
Ensure that your design works across various devices and screen sizes.
5. PROTOTYPING
‚Ä¢	Interactive Prototypes:
Create interactive prototypes using Figma‚Äôs prototyping features to simulate user interactions.
‚Ä¢	Usability Testing:
Conduct usability tests to identify pain points and gather user feedback.
‚Ä¢	Iterate Based on Feedback:
Refine your designs and prototypes based on the insights gathered during testing.
6. HANDOFF & DEVELOPMENT
‚Ä¢	Documentation:
Document all design specifications, including colors, typography, spacing, and component behavior.
‚Ä¢	Design Handoff Tools:
Use tools like Figma Inspect, Zeplin, or similar for a smooth transition of design assets to developers.
‚Ä¢	Collaboration:
Work closely with the development team to ensure that the design is implemented correctly. Clarify any uncertainties during the handoff process.
7. LAUNCH & ITERATION
‚Ä¢	Post-Launch Monitoring:
After launching your product, monitor user feedback and analytics to assess performance.
‚Ä¢	Continuous Improvement:
Regularly update and refine your design based on user behavior, new requirements, and emerging trends.
‚Ä¢	Iterative Testing:
Continue to run usability tests and incorporate feedback into future iterations.


now to do phase 3 i wanna do 2
and to do to it need output from one 

so I'll give u this output
before i show u the overall work flow for the project

1.	Convert tables from the database to Models and set up DbContext in the Data Directory using scaffolding:
2.	dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Name=DefaultConnection" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models
3.	Define Dtos for different endpoints as needed, for exaple
a.	Read Dto Requests
i.	"Entity"Dto (for list view)
ii.	"Entity"DetailsDto (for details view of specific entity)
b.	Write Dto Requests
i.	Create"Entity"RequestDto
ii.	Patch"Entity"RequestDto
4.	Configure Manual Mapper
5.	Create Repository Interfaces
6.	Create QueryObject in Helpers Dir for filtering and sort operations for entities.
7.	Implement Repository
8.	Create Controllers
9.	Register Dependencies in Program.cs file

so the part that i work on is 
PART 2: GOAL MANAGEMENT (IN-PROGRESS)
and i finished the DB and the backend 
the backend is api doc with attachment

I wanna do UI/UX for the landing page and Goal Management part (current epic)
with considering other parts in main sections as like give it icon to press on it and enter but its not working
the only one to work in details now is  Goal Management part (current epic)


I'm learning, so i need guidline and how to execute this like professionals in 2025 modern web development do

so u r experienced guide for me 
take ur space to response maybe in multiple messages its ok
give me ur opinion first then outline for what we gonna do 

use reasoning and search if need, if not its okay dont use it, im very beginner in ui ux as i said
